This project was created to showcase my skills to build a website based off the skills I have learned so far using HTML and CSS.

The website I created is dedicated to the statistics of NBA players and teams.

Technologies I used for this project are HTML and CSS.

Here are the 3 improvements I would make for my site:
 1. Be able to pull live data automatically for statistics.
 2. Add a News page that updates the user on the latest NBA news and rumors.
 3. Add a lot more statistics.
